                    <p>The domesticated canine is a descendant of the wolf and is also known as the domestic dog. It originated from the extinct species of the Pleistocene wolf. Before humans started farming, dogs were the first animals domesticated by hunters around 15,000 years ago. Since humans have domesticated dogs, they have expanded to a large population. Because of their association with humans, they have developed an ability to tolerate a starch-rich diet. Over the millennia, various breeds have been selectively bred to improve their physical attributes, sensory capabilities, and behaviors. The sizes, shapes, and colors of these animals vary. Adopted by humans, dogs are known to perform various roles such as hunting, protecting, and serving as companions.
                         Since humans have domesticated dogs, the canine bond has been studied and the animal has been regarded as the best friend of humans.

                <li>  A dog’s nose print is unique, much like a person’s fingerprint.</li>
                <li> . A dog’s sense of smell is legendary, but did you know that his nose has as many as 300 million receptors? In comparison, a human nose has about 5 million.</li>
                <li> Dogs are not colorblind. They can see blue and yellow.</li>
                <li>. The Bloodhound’s sense of smell is so accurate that the results of its tracking can be used as evidence in a court of law. </li>
